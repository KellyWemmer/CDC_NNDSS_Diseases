# CDC_NNDSS_Diseases

The data from this analysis comes from the NNDSS - Table I. infrequently reported notifiable diseases 

Data can viewed and downloaded at: https://healthdata.gov/dataset/nndss-table-i-infrequently-reported-notifiable-diseases-1

This analysis was my first solo project. It is a bit bulky and not very pretty, but it worked. If I had to do it over, I would have re-organized the tables to make it easier for plotting facetplot grids instead of having to plot line graphs individually for each year.
